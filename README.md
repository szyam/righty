### Add Righty to your project:

Download the folder from here or github
insert it in your scss folder
@import "righty";
Your done! If, you want to incorporate some of the bundled modules, you'll need to comment them back in, in the _righty file.

## Why Righty?

All tools are built to solve a problem. Righty is a light-weight, easy to use yet efficient, OOCSS grid, with a few additional modules and scripts.
Who is Righty for?

We love huge frameworks, that cover all the bases. For a largeand complex project, that will utilize a lot of the pull-this & push-that, and all the offsets and different computed styles for several breakpoints, we like Foundation alot.

But for many small & medium sized projects, we just dont need all the overhead. Righty comes equiped with a common, 12 column grid (can be changed through sass variables), several helper classes, some extra modules if you'd like as well as a couple scripts that may come in handy.
